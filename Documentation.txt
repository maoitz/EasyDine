EasyDine Backend Project â€” Roadmap & Status
            
DONE:

    Re-did Booking model to use DateTime for bookings instead of separate date and timespan.
    Updated repos/services/dtos/controllers accordingly.
    Updated overlap logic to work with DateTime only.
    Removed Time-slot model entirely.
    Implemented BookingRulesOptions for configurable rules (min/max duration etc.)
    Added custom duration to make bookings more flexible instead of the time slots
    Added Extensions folder:
         - DateTimeExtensions.cs for truncation logic.
         - IQueryableExtensions for dynamic filtering (MenuItems). (TBD)
    
    Added NuGet package: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer
    Implemented JWT authentication for Admins.
    Added AdminCreateDto, AdminChangePasswordDto
    Implemented AuthController with login endpoint.
    Created temp seeding for Admin user with hashed password.
    
    Implemented [Authorize] on relevant controllers.
    Configured JWT settings in appsettings.json and Program.cs.
    Refactored [Authorize] into a filter, so all write endpoints are protected by default.
    
    Dropped DB to clean up after model changes.
    Re-ran migrations and reseeded data.
    
    Created ServiceCollectionExtensions for cleaner DI setup in Program.cs.
    
FIX/BUGS/TO-DO:

    api/Menus/{id}/items returns incomplete data:
     - No Description or Category per Item. (DONE)
     
    Add specific error handling message in middleware per entity ex. "Menu not found" (instead of generic "Not Found").
    Add Rejection for empty body partial updates with 400 Bad Request?
    "Soft delete" customers / save all customers?
        - Reset ID counter in SeedData to avoid conflicts
        
    Orphaned seed data
    Add more customer info on booking response (phone/email)?
    Look over controllers for soft delete / cascading deletes with fluent API
    
FUCKUP:

    Don't separate date and time using timespan in bookings. Combine into single DateTime field.
